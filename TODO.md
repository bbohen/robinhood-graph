* check out union or interface to avoid repetitive root resolver like seen in the quote schema resolvers
* consider redoing schema to be more quote centric
* anything that has a type of "Url" should probably be a type of its own with a resolver to the relevant REST endpoint instead. remove url custom scalar when this is done
* create subscriptions for specific changes
