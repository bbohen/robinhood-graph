- fully finish schema (add "stock" schema to combine other schema together?)
- anything that has a type of "Url" should probably be a type of its own with a resolver to the relevant REST endpoint instead. remove url custom scalar when this is done
- add unofficial docs into schema docs
- create subscriptions for specific changes
- create cli tool? alert system? app?
